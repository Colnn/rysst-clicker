# RYSST Clicker

Written in React and Typescript, this [Cookie Clicker](https://ozh.github.io/cookieclicker/) clone, based on the [RYSST](https://www.rysst.nl) company, is **the** way to spend your time when you're bored!

## How to run

In case you're using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run this command to get the correct node version. Otherwise, install Node v18.15.0 manually.

```
nvm use
```

Install the dependencies, --legacy-peer-deps is necessary because some dependencies need different versions of React.

```
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

Run the development environment, it should start running at [http://localhost:5173/]()

```
npm run dev
```
